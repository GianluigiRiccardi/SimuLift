# Simulift

**Predictive lifting safety model in Simulink. Evaluates wind, impact, and overload to ensure safe crane operations.**

## Introduction

**SimuLift** is a predictive safety model developed in Simulink for analyzing crane lifting operations. The model helps prevent accidents by evaluating impact force, overload conditions, and wind force in advance, providing clear visual safety indicators.

This project is intended for engineers, technicians, and students who want to simulate realistic lifting scenarios and enhance safety in construction sites or industrial environments.

## Features

- Impact force calculation
- Crane overload analysis
- Wind force evaluation (Beaufort scale)
- Visual safety status indicators (color-coded/icons)
- Easily adjustable parameters for scenario testing
