# Simulift
Predictive lifting safety model in Simulink. Evaluates wind, impact, and overload to ensure safe crane operations.

**SimuLift** is a Simulink-based predictive safety model for lifting operations.  
It evaluates impact force, overload conditions, and wind force to determine whether a lifting operation is safe.

## Features

- Impact force calculation
- Crane overload analysis
- Wind force based on Beaufort scale
- Visual safety status indicators

## Folders

- `/img` — icons used in the Simulink model
- `/docs` — (you can add documentation, screenshots, diagrams here)

## Usage

Open `SimuLift.slx` in MATLAB Simulink and run the model.  
Modify constants to simulate different lifting conditions.
