# Simulift

**Predictive Safety Model for Lifting Operations**

Simulift is a MATLAB Simulink model that evaluates whether a lifting operation is safe, based on:
- Impact force (mass × height ÷ deformation)
- Load vs crane capacity (with safety factor)
- Wind pressure (from Beaufort scale and exposed area)
